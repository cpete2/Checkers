	</br> the checkers on the board.  This object will also keep track of when a checker peice has been jumped by an opponent and remove it from the bored 
	</br> using funtions that do that with in it.  
	
	<h2>The Fuctions</h2>
	</br> There will be serveral funtions for this game:
	<ul>
		<li>RemoveCheck Funtction:  takes an interger of a paramater and returns the number of check objects for a certain color after check has been removed.
		<li>KingChecker Function: This funtion will allow the check to move backwards on the board once the player reaches their oponents side.
		<li>ColorCheck Function:  This fustion set the players choice of color checker.
