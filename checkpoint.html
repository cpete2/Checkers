<h1>Check Point</h1>
<h2 class="class3">My Progress</h2>
<p>Although my game is not finished, many things are coming along nicely as I learn how to design and impliment this game.
I have been able to make great progress in some of the compnenets of the games.  Below I will list specifically what components
I have been abel to implment already and what ones I haven't. I will also show how you can test some of the logic of the game.
AlthoughI have not yet understood the rest of the logic yet to make the game, I will continue to work on that to be able to impliment
it before the semester ends. Some other componentest besides the logic I will talk about that I have been able to do include creating
a start page with links to other pages and create a CSS page to style my game uniformly.</p>
<h2 class="class3">Components of game logic</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML grid generation-Using to "for" loops my game generates html table as a checker board
<li>Boad Set Up-Using a 2D array my grid goes through each element of that table and loads pieces into place.
<li>Clear Board-Using a javascrip "for" loop my game can clear out the board and reset it for playing again.
<li>Clickable td elements-My java script code sets an onlclick atritbute for each td element so I know where the user has clicked.
<li>Rules of the game-I will use a java script d2 array to keep track of where players can and cannon mover their pieces.
<li>Score keeping-I will have javascript code that helps keep track of the score of each player.
</ul>
<h2 class="class3">What components have and have not been implemented</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML grid generation-This is implimented and you can see this by clicking the Start button on the fist html page
<li>Boad Set Up-This is working, you can see this by clicking Start on the grid page
<li>Clear Board-This is working, you can see this by clicking the Reset button on the grid page below the start button.
<li>Clickable td elements-This is working, you can see this by clicking any place on the board and seeing the table data element change.
<li>Rules of the game-This is not ready yet.
<li>Score keeping-This is not ready yet.
</ul>
